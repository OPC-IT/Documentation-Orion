# Explaination



The **"Orion Dashboard"** (also known as "ConnectWise Dashboard" or "ConnectWise Module") serves the fundamental purpose of give a holistic view for the website client, and give then information regards to the company details in the record, a histogram of the hours they have been spending in the the past month, and a list of ticket they opened recently.

For **performance reasons**, we can only display a limited amount of entries on the histogram and ticket, the threshold is around 14 days, if you go over this the site may be extremely slow to load; Or in the worst condition, even timeout and raise a failure.

The "**Orion Dashboard**" module is a one page module, and can be divided into three components:

-   **Company Overview**, which allows client to inspect the address, contact, etc they propogate on our connectwise database. Bringing ease for confirmation of informations.

-   **Time-Spenditure Histogram**, which allows client to inspect their spending in the **past two weeks**, a client can choose the time range by clicking on the calendar icon (the other from/to time will update accordingly)
