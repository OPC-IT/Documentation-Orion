# Explaination

The "**Orion Security**" module serves the fundamental purpose of monitoring a website and providing vital information such as its HTTP status (active or down), PHP version, CMS version, pending updates, and pending security updates. This monitoring process enables a company's maintainer to keep track of the website's current status and promptly perform updates and patches whenever necessary. By utilizing this module, the maintainer can ensure that the website remains secure, up-to-date, and fully functional, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.



The "**Orion Security**" module can be divided into three pages:

-   **List Overview**, which provides a comprehensive and holistic view of the website being monitored. This page allows the maintainer to quickly identify any potential issues and take appropriate action.
-   **Website Details**, which provides in-depth information about the monitoring process. This page displays the exact modules that are pending updates and security patches, enabling the maintainer to prioritize and address them accordingly.
-   **Settings** page, which allows the maintainer to configure and customize the monitoring settings to meet their specific needs. This page also provides the option to add new monitoring for additional websites.
